# MinVR-Labyrinth
Most of this code is taken from Tom Sgouros's demo-graphic repository (https://github.com/tsgouros/demo-graphic). So far I've added some assets and modified kbDemoMinVR.cpp so that I don't have to change the cmake stuff. 

kbDemoMinVR contains the actual Labyrinth game. Directions for installing the project with cmake are in the demo-graphic README. Once installed, the game can be built and run by running

`make && bin/kbDemoMinVR -c ../config/desktop-wand.xml`

from the build folder
