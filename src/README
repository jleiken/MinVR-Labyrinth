                     Baby Scene Graph Library

The files in this directory make up the source code for the "baby
scene graph" library.  This is sort of like training wheels for
computer graphics.  It is a functional scene graph library, with a few
nice features, and consistent handling of the various matrices.  But
it is a baby package.  If you find a feature missing from it, perhaps
consider that you're ready to graduate to a real scene graph package.
Like OSG, for example.  The build is set up to create doxygen output,
so please find the rest of the documentation there.

To build the documentation, execute cmake and make like this:

    $ cmake .. -DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION





TODO list:

  This is a list limited by our desire not to construct a replacement
  for real scene graph packages, but at the same time we want
  something that will take care of most of the needs of new users.

  - More basic shapes to the bsgMenagerie.

  - OBJ file loader does not yet handle materials.
  
  - Only PNG textures currently supported.  Need other graphics file
    formats to be available (JPG, BMP, TIF).

  - Mipmap support in OpenGL?

  - Better interactivity support with MinVR.  (Ray selection? Device
    abstraction?)
